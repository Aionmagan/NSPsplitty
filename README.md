# NSPsplitty

this is a simple tool to split '.nsp' files to fit in the 'fat32' file system 
the Nintedo switch uses 

it was made as a more straight forward tool with a graphical interface 
and it's exclusive for Windows 10 use only 

it was heavily inspired by **AnalogMan151** work

if you want to use such a tool on any other OS then please use AnalogMan's work, 
to understand the use of this tool more deeply also go read up on his git 
and check his amazing documentation on how splitting .nsp files works 

in short on how to use the tool 

## Browse button
    browse to .nsp file location (split folder will also be created in the same location)
## Check box:
    to create a copy or not (leaving it checked is recommended, requires double the storage space of the file)
## Split button
    to start splitting files, wait it takes a bit 
## Console box 
    reports activity for the user to know it's not frozen
